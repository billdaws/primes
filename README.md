checking an algorithm I (hopefully) created for prime number generation

pre-computed primes provided by primes.utm.edu

note as of early august 2019: I noticed that my solution is very similar to the sieve approach in EPI, 
just that the sieve uses a lot of memory to make some optimizations about computing for multiples of
known primes. The same could be done with my approach, but it would be harder to read/write.

As such I don't consider it very necessary to continue this, but I might at some point.
